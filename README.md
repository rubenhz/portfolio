# My Portfolio

Hi, I'm Ruben, a web developer. I have been involved in coding for a long time, starting when I was about 15. I had seen a video about data analysis with Python, and I thought it was amazing that one person can deal with so much data with just a programming language. Soon after learning the basics on Python, I moved on to JavaScript, where I learned how to make a website dynamic.

Over the past few years, I started taking coding much more seriously, and enrolled in a Web Development Bootcamp, where I got my certification in Web Development. Having that foundaintion, I picked up React and Angular as my two technologies of choice to build responsive web applications and websites.

I love working with React, Angular, Tailwind CSS, and Python. I truly believe that learning never stops, and it's one of the reasons why I'm passionate about this field.
